			<h1>Branches</h1>
		<p class="paragraph">As a digital coffee business, Digital Espresso operates primarily online and delivers coffee products directly to customers' doorsteps. However, as the business grows, some potential branches or expansion options could include:<br><br>

			1. Partnering with local cafes and restaurants to offer Digital Espresso blends as a menu item.<br><br>
			2. Opening a physical coffee shop or pop-up location to offer customers a more immersive experience with the brand.<br><br>
			3. Expanding the product line to include other coffee-related items such as brewing equipment, merchandise, or even coffee-based skincare products.<br><br>
			4. Offering corporate or wholesale partnerships with businesses looking to offer high-quality coffee to their employees or customers.</p>
